# CoinWeight

A coin weighing game with n >= 2 coins: n - 2 real coins and 2 fake, lighter coins.
Written in C++, it implements a computer that consistently find the fake coins in at most ceil(log_3 n) + ceil(log_3 n/2) weighings, at most one more than the known lower bound for any n >= 2.

Note: The project is still on development and will see some changes, especially in x11 interface.
